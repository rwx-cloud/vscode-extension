# 🧪 Testing Instructions:
#
# 1. Find All References on "setup" task (line 10)
#    - Right-click on "setup" in the key definition
#    - Select "Find All References" or press Shift+F12
#    - Should highlight:
#      * Line 10: key: setup (declaration)
#      * Line 32: use: setup (single use)
#      * Line 35: use: [setup, build] (array use)
#      * Line 43: use: setup (single use)
#
# 2. Find All References on "build" task (line 13)  
#    - Should highlight:
#      * Line 13: key: build (declaration)
#      * Line 35: use: [setup, build] (array use)
#      * Line 38: use: [build, test, lint] (array use)
#
# 3. Find All References on "test" task (line 16)
#    - Should highlight:
#      * Line 16: key: test (declaration)  
#      * Line 38: use: [build, test, lint] (array use)
#      * Line 41: use: test (single use)
#
# 4. Find All References on "lint" task (line 20)
#    - Should highlight:
#      * Line 20: key: lint (declaration)
#      * Line 38: use: [build, test, lint] (array use)
#
# 5. Find All References on "unused-task" (line 23)
#    - Should only highlight:
#      * Line 23: key: unused-task (declaration only, no uses)
#
# 6. Test "Include Declaration" option works correctly
#    - The task definition should be included when the option is enabled
#    - Only the use references should show when disabled
